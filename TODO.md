# TODO :)

##### Last updated: 02-08-2024 @ 00:59

### Legacy chillbot.v3 code left to replace:
> - Automod - #feedback channel rule enforcer [MAYBE]
> - Admin - Invite Creation
> - Admin - NOIMG command for moderation
> - Greetings - System User Notification


### To add later
> - Resonance Leaderboard System (check legacy chillbot.V3 code for guidance?)
> - /artlinks command for posting DB link of user-submitted links in #art-stage
> - /links - user submitted modal (similar to /socials) ==OR== /socials combine???
> - /unlock and /lock - manual media channel lock/unlock
> - - Auto-lock \#showcase-submissions media channel until Sun 23:59 UTC, then unlock 

### BUGS TO SQUISH
> - Automod - #demos Albert sticker react pings but deletes sticker
> - - Ideal outcome: **DO NOT** react in #demos and delete sticker as normal
